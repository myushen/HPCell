\title{Calculate Appropriate Gamma Values for Metacell Analysis}
\usage{
calculate_gamma(cell_count, min_cells_per_metacell = 30)
}
\arguments{
\item{cell_count}{Integer, the total number of cells.}

\item{min_cells_per_metacell}{Integer, the minimum number of cells allowed per metacell. Defaults to 30.}
}
\value{
An Integer vector of viable gamma values. If no viable gamma values are found, returns 0.
}
\description{
This function determines viable gamma (γ) values to be used in metacell analysis. Gamma is a graining level
parameter that controls the degree of cell aggregation when creating metacells. It represents the ratio
between the original number of cells and the desired number of metacells.
}
\details{
For example:
\itemize{
\item γ = 2: combines cells to create metacells, aiming for half as many metacells as original cells
\item γ = 4: aims for one-fourth as many metacells
\item γ = 8: aims for one-eighth as many metacells
And so on, using powers of 2.
}

The function starts with γ = 2 and doubles it repeatedly (2, 4, 8, 16...) until the ratio of
cells/gamma would result in metacells that are smaller than the minimum allowed size. Higher gamma
values mean more aggressive aggregation (fewer, larger metacells), while lower gamma values preserve
more granularity (more, smaller metacells).
